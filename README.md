# Agentic Engineering

This repository provides a minimal, practical guide for using LLMs/agents in software projects without losing engineering rigor. Read `AGENTIC_ENGINEERING_GUIDE.md` for the complete workflow, guardrails, and prompts. Use it to research, plan, implement, validate, and ship changes with strict scope control, diff-only outputs, and mandatory human review.
